MERN TodoApp Deployment Guide on Amazon Lightsail with Nginx Reverse Proxy

Welcome to the deployment guide for the MERN TodoApp on Amazon Lightsail with Nginx reverse proxy! This guide will walk you through the necessary steps to deploy the full-stack TodoApp application, built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, on an Amazon Lightsail instance. Additionally, we will utilize Nginx as a reverse proxy server to handle incoming requests and efficiently route them to our TodoApp.

Let's get started with the deployment process and have your MERN TodoApp up and running on Amazon Lightsail in no time!

Note: This guide assumes you have basic knowledge of Amazon Lightsail, Nginx, and the MERN stack. If you're new to any of these technologies, we recommend referring to their respective documentation for a better understanding.
